	<h1>Hi there, I'm Kyle Pecsok! I'm a M.S. GIS student at Clark University.</h1>
	<p>My name is Kyle Pecsok, and I am a recent graduate of Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Geography and a minor in Sociology. I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Geographic Information Science (GIS) at Clark University as part of their Advanced Degree Program. My main interests related to GIS are in Urban Development, Community Health, and Climate Resiliency. Outside of classwork, I am currently a Teaching Assistant for Florencia Sangermano's course “Advacned Raster GIS”. Throughout my Advanced Degree Program at Clark University, I have been involved in different research projects and positions. Organizations that I have been involved in for research or GIS work include the Wildlife Conservation Society, Clark Labs, and two student researcher positions at a National-Science Foundation funded Research Experience for Undergraduates, at University of South Florida and Rochester Institute of Technology. Within Clark University I was a Peer Learning Assistant for Robert Gilmore Pontius Jr.’s course “GIS & Land Change Models” and completed an honors thesis with my advisor Rinku Roy Chowdhury about the populations and landscapes exposed to future sea-level rise in Miami-Dade County, Florida. This is a secondary website that shows some of the work that I have produced in Shadrock Roberts' "Web Mapping & Open Source GIS" course. My primary website is at kylepecsok.weebly.com.</p>
